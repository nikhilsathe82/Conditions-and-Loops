Conditional Statements help you to make a decisions based on certain conditions and thereby control the flow of program. Also, known as decision-making statement
they are useful in error and exception handling, program execution flow, and much more.

In JavaScript, there are four types of conditional statements:

If statement:
The if statement executes a specified code segment if the given condition is true.
syntax:
if (condition){
  # code to execute if condition is true
}else{
  # code to execute if condition is false
}

example:
if (age <12){
  console.log("Age is less than 12");
} else{
   console.log("Age is greater than 12");
};



Else statement:
The else statement executes the code associated with it if the given if condition is false.
syntax:
if (condition){
  # code to execute if condition is true
}else{
  # code to execute if condition is false };

example:
if (age <12){
  console.log("Age is less than 12");
} else{
   console.log("Age is greater than 12");
};

Else if statement:
The else if statement specifies a new condition for testing when the first if condition is false.
syntax:
if (condition1){
  # code to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2){
  # code to execute if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
}else if (condition3){
  # code to execute if condition1 and condition2 are false and condition3 is true
}else {
  # code to execute if all conditions are false
}

example:
function grades(marks) {

    if(marks>=90){
        console.log("You have got grade A");
        return;           
    } else if (marks<90 && marks>=70) {
        console.log("You have got grade B");
      return;
    } else if (marks<70 && marks>=50) {
        console.log("You have got grade C");
      return;
    } else {
        console.log("You have got grade F");
      return;
    }   
}

grades(45);


Switch-case statement:
The switch-case statement specifies multiple alternative code blocks for execution and executes these cases based on certain conditions.
syntax:
switch(variable/expression) {
    case value1:  
        // body of case 1
        break;

    case value2:  
        // body of case 2
        break;

    case valueN:
        // body of case N
        break;

    default:
        // body of default
}

example:
// program using switch statement
let a = 2;

switch (a) {

    case 1:
        a = 'one';
        break;
    case 2:
        a = 'two';
        break;
    default:
        a = 'not found';
        break;
}
console.log(`The value is ${a}`);
